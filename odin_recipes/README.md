Before beginning the project:

This is my first Odin Project project and the goal 
is to create a website that links to various 
recipes. Will recap at the end of the assignment.  

Post assignment thoughts: by far, the toughest aspects of the assignment were centered around element alignment. In order to create a makeshift nav bar and to display the recipe descriptions and ingredient lists side by side, I dabbled with float styles and in-line block display. Most of my time was spent ensuring the instructions on the bottom of the page were centered and "wrapped" around the ingredient section although I was unable to make the wrap happen and resorted to manipualing div heights instead in order to push them just below the description. This was the most time-consuming process in building this site and involved using explicit pixel values which I disliked commiting to. I am looking forward to learning about more efficient methods for acheiving a similar layout that refrain from using arbitrary dimensions.
