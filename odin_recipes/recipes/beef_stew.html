                    <p>This is an easy to prepare beef stew recipe that you can walk away from once you've 
                    tossed all the ingredients in the pot. I often like to get this meal started before
                    I finish up some chores around the house so I have a <em>delicious</em>, 
                    nourishing meal to look forward to once I'm done. </p>

                <li>First, let&rsquo;s prepare the beef cubes by rubbing in salt and pepper, 
                    and then coating them with flour afterward. </li>
                <li>Next, let&rsquo;s dice the onions and garlic and sautee them in a pot over low-medium heat.</li>
                <li>While those are softening up, chop the celery and carrots (after you peel them), and then add them
                    to the sautee.</li>
                <li>Once the base veggies are softened, we&rsquo;re ready to add the beef chunks. Lay them in the pot, under
                    the garlic and onions and turn the heat up a bit in order to brown the sides.</li>
                <li>Add the parsley while the beef is browning. Make sure to turn the chunks as needed in order to sear the sides evenly.</li>
                <li>Once the beef is brown and all sides, we can add the tomato paste, sugar and Worcester sauce, and mix them in with the rest 
                    of the ingredients in the pot.</li>
                <li>Once they tomato paste has been incorporated with the beef and veggies, add the water, potatoes (peeled and cubed) and peas, and bring to a boil.</li> 
                <li>Once the water comes to a boil, immediately drop to a simmer and cover the pot.</li> 
                <li>After about an hour, take the cover off in order to allow the stew to reduce a bit. Cook uncovered for about
                    another hour.</li>
                <li>Serve with rice or whatever you please!</li>
